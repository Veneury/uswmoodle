<p><span style="background-color: #00ff00;">don't forget you could also create a module timetable by adding recurring entries on the module calendar! This would appear for all students in their calendar on their MyCourses page without them having to go back to each module - Get put it on there for every module in the programme and the students have a full calendar based timetable.</span></p>
